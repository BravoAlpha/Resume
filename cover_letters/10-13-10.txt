Hi there,

My name is Nathaniel Welch. I'm currently a computer science student
at Cal Poly in sunny San Luis Obispo, CA. I'm going to be graduating
in the spring, so it's possible I am not the candidate you are looking
for. But if you don't need your new hire immediately, I could very
well be the man you are looking for.

My resume is at http://icco.github.com/Resume and my personal site is
http://natwelch.com. For the last year and a half I have been working
for iFixit.com, solving all sorts of fun technical problems on a team
of seven. We've built our entire system by hand, and I've had my hands
in the thick of it all from day one. I've been a sysadmin, because our
entire site is run out of ec2 and we deal with crazy spikes of traffic
(http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4-Teardown/3130/1). I have done
graphic design stuff including lots of javascript, photography for PR,
and classic html and css. We run on MySQL and I've been heavily
involved in the design of our constantly evolving system.

Outside of work, I love learning new things. I've experimented a ton
with ruby, and gotten totally hooked. I love the language and try to
use it in a lot of my personal projects.

In my free time, when I'm not trying out some new crazy idea, I'm
usually hiking and/or reading a book. I love music, enjoy a good beer
and am a huge believer in open source.

Anyway, shoot me back an email if you have any questions for me. I'm
originally from the Bay Area, grew up in Los Altos, Santa Rosa and Los
Gatos, so I have no problem moving back there.

/Nat
